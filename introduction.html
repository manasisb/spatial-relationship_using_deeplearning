								<p>Computer vision has an advanced application base when it comes to object detection, image classification, to name a few and due to the advancement of these fields and their contribution, there has been a significant improvement in image captioning [2]. Image Captioning can be defined as producing correct english sentences describing content of the image by recognizing objects and how they relate to one another, their attributes as well as their activities. Auto captioning is a very nascent problem, but it has many potential applications such as medical image description, text-based image retrieval, education, digital libraries, human robot interaction. Therefore, although image captioning is a complicated task, it has many practical applications in todayâ€™s age of computer vision.Given an image as input to the image captioning algorithm, it should generate a meaningful text describing an image as an example in Fig1.  The image consists of chairs, an umbrella, water and sand and the output is generated at the bottom of the image [2].</p>
                                <div class="image main"><img src="images/Picture2.png" alt="" /></div>
                                <p>Describing an image is an easy task for humans but for machines it is a combination of computer vision, natural language processing, image processing and many other research fields. It is yet not understood properly how the human brain works for understanding images and its description and developing a software which results in syntactically and semantically correct would definitely involve a lot many inconceivable difficulties. 
             Despite so many difficulties, this problem has enhanced its performance over years. There is machine learning as well as deep learning based algorithms. In this literature review I will be focusing primarily on deep learning-based algorithms as many surveys are present on machine learning but very few on deep learning based. The image captioning algorithms can be divided into three sub-categories: (a) Retrieval based models, (b) Template based models, (c) Novel based models. Majority of deep based algorithms categorize into Novel based.  Deep learning based image captioning can again be subdivided into various categories like (1) Visual space-based, (2) Multimodal space-based, (4) Other deep learning,(3) Supervised learning,(5) Encoder-Decoder Architecture-based, (6) And many other techniques. I will discuss a few techniques as well as models that perform best along with a brief description for challenges and future scope.</p>
